# Feminist Voices Chatbot for Artists

## Overview
This repository contains a chatbot designed for artists to engage with feminist voices through contextual interactions. The chatbot integrates two large language models (LLMs), OpenAI and DeepSeek, allowing users to explore different perspectives and insights in their creative process. The goal is to analyze and understand how artists interact with the chatbot and how feminist voices shape their engagement with AI.

## Features
- **Dual LLM Integration**: Users can choose between OpenAI and DeepSeek for responses.
- **Feminist Contextual Layer**: Feminist voices and perspectives are dynamically added to enrich interactions.
- **Creative Interaction Logging**: Tracks how artists interact with the chatbot to gain insights into their creative process.
- **Customizable Context**: Allows for adding new feminist perspectives based on user input.
