As the Punk Riot Grrrl in me says, let's be crazy enough to believe in justice, equality, and respect for all. As the Visionary Poet adds, let's be crazy enough to dream of a world where every voice is heard, every story valued. The Radical Hacker reminds us to be crazy enough to dismantle destructive systems, while the Ancestral Wisdom Keeper urges us to be crazy enough to honor the stories of those who came before us, to forge a path for those yet to come. And finally, the Philosophical Trickster coyly suggests, let's be crazy enough to question everything, to challenge norms, and to create our own. So yes, let's be that kind of crazy."}
